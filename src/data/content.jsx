How Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) works (Surface Level Understanding) : The data we needed for rules (Pdfs downloaded from official government sites) had their text extracted, split into chunks and then converted into numerical arrays called vector embeddings. The user's query is also converted into a vector and then they system finds the closest matching chunks. These chunks are then passed as context to the LLM to generate an answer. I used this RAG system because I didn't want a hallucinating chatbot. Would love to study the math behind all of this and build a system like this from scratch without any ai assistance in the future. 2.Choosing the right database for the job : I understood why we needed a vector store (FAISS) to handle the search over the legal documents but a JSON dataset for the challan calculator as fine amounts are exact, not approximate. Knowing what storage solutions should be implemented is important in system design. 3.Running AI Models Locally : When openai api credits weren't available , I learned how to swap to a locally run model (mistral) by using the ollama architecture.", // ← paste your extended write-up here

Specifically how ground effect basically turns a car's underbody into a giant Venturi that sucks it onto the track.I wanted to see that pressure drop happen in real life, not just stare at diagrams. So I modeled a tiny ground tunnel in TinkerCad, exported the STL, and then rebuilt the same shape with cardboard and masking tape along with my teammate because sometimes you've gotta go analog (I could not have built the rig without him). I then imported the STL into SimScale, slapped on inlet/outlet boundary conditions, meshed it up, and ran the CFD sim. Meanwhile, the cardboard version got a fan taped to one end and a hole cut along the throat where the tunnel tightens. Stuck a tissue over it. Turned the fan on. The tissue immediately got pulled into the tunnel, no ambiguity, just a piece of paper getting vacuumed inward by the pressure differential on either side. Same physics showed up in the simulation streamlines and in my janky cardboard setup. Kind of wild that a principle keeping F1 cars planted at 300 km/h also works with masking tape and a CPU fan.

    details: "Built this as our team's Round 1 submission for ISRO's Bharatiya Antariksh Hackathon 2026, tackling infrared image colorization for Landsat 9 thermal data (Problem Statement PS10). Just to be upfront, this stayed at the planning/architecture stage since it was for the round 1 submission that we didn't clear, so no working prototype yet. But the amount I learned designing it made it worth it. Planned a two stage pipeline: first, an SRCNN model to super-resolve blurry 200m thermal images into sharp 100m ones (with a physics informed loss to keep predicted temperatures physically realistic so that there is no model hallucinating -40°C deserts). Second, a Pix2Pix GAN to colorize that thermal data into interpretable RGB, conditioned on vegetation index and land use type so it doesn't confuse a shadowed forest with a shadowed parking lot.Getting into the weeds of this taught me a lot about how models actually learn; forward passes, backprop, why GANs need a discriminator to avoid blurry outputs, why spectral normalization keeps that discriminator from overpowering the generator, and why train/test splits need to be done by entire scenes (not random patches) to avoid the model secretly cheating on nearby, near identical patches. Equally valuable was the experience I got from managing the team : this was a 4 person interdisciplinary team and figuring out how to map each person's strengths onto a concrete piece of the pipeline like physics-informed loss design, signal processing, model architecture and keep everyone aligned on a tight deadline was its own kind of learning.",

    details: "Built a radar inspired speed detector from scratch using an RCWL-0516 microwave sensor and an Arduino UNO. The sensor emits a 3.18 GHz signal; when it bounces off a moving object, the Doppler shift creates a beat frequency that the Arduino samples, crunches through the Doppler formula, and displays live speed in km/h on a 16x2 LCD. This was my first real electronics project : breadboards, datasheets, soldering fumes, the whole deal. While leading the team I learned how to read analog signals, do frequency estimation , condition noisy sensor data, and actually make a physical thing respond to code I wrote. It was genuinely fun going from how does radar even work? to waving my hand in front of a sensor and watching numbers pop up on a screen. Total build cost was under ₹900, took about two days, and taught me more about signal processing and hardware-software integration than any tutorial ever could. ",

    // Paste your full post text here between the backticks:
    body: `All of us have a purpose, to contribute in making or building something in the future. We think we might as well get paid for it as part of an occupation. 
    So we start preparing ourselves to become capable. I think there is more than one way to do this :
    A College Degree ; This is the most sought-after and popular way to become capable of being employed or building something.
    Almost everyone pursues a college degree to become an engineer (and other degrees as well but I am speaking for engineers only,
    because I’m doing the same thing). This is where a group of professionals , who have made themselves capable by building things put together a curriculum for you to study.
    Now this curriculum works on what I call ‘generalization across the same domain’, (this domain being your own degree specialization). Here, the organization has no idea what
    type of job role you might land or what type of project you want to build and that’s why they put almost every general thing related to your domain in the curriculum.
    Here, students learn a little bit of everything to pass their exams and many have to learn additional things when they get a job offer that requires them to do work needing
    different skills than what the course taught them. A lot of time is also wasted in learning things they’ll probably never use in their work.
    But even though I criticize this system , it is probably the safest system for a lot of individuals.`,

    title: "Why most people remain the same throughout their life.",
    excerpt: "Changing is difficult",
    body: `We are effectively conditioned to become who we are because of the environment & people around us. One can tell a lot about a person based off of the people around them & the environment they live in. Human lives come embedded with ambition. A life without ambition is as good as no life at all in my opinion. Chasing certain ambitions requires us to change in a way that provides us a favor towards achieving it. But maximum number of individuals will spend their life trying to jump from one ambition to another because they can’t achieve one as they find it hard to change.To change a thing about oneself is difficult. To change oneself is arduous.
    Why? Because changing oneself is, even though one might find it hard to believe not completely in one’s own hands. The way one acts is because of the environment around him & he has been conditioned in a way to react to it for all the time he has lived.
    To change oneself demands acting against to your conditioning that you have followed for so long. To act differently than your usual self feels unsettling because it feels like you’re losing your identity. Let me give you an example; I’m partial to a cup of tea in the morning and the evening. I like it so much so that everyone who knows me knows that I love me some tea. So whenever I’m with my relatives or friends , they say things like, “You like tea, have some/Let’s have some”. I’m almost known for loving tea. But its not healthy for me & it leads to body heat issues. But saying ‘no’ to tea feels uncomfortable or wrong because I’ve been doing it for so long that it feels like a part of my identity & if I do say no then I will lose those conversations with people about tea. This is just an example of why going against the things you are usually inclined to do feels so uncomfortable.
    Deviating from your intuitive actions feels unsettling because you’re moving towards losing a part of your identity. But if you create a new part/analog to the element you wish to deviate from then the process of doing so will be much easier. It’s important to remember that this analog must be realistic & explicitly defined.`,
